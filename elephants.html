            <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
<P>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidae.Two 
    species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant(Loxodonta africana) 
    and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that 
    African bush elephants and African forest elephants are seperate species
(L.africana and L.cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout 
sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only
surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other,now extinct,members of the 
 order include deinotheres,gomphotheres,mammoths,and mastodons. Male African elephants are
  the largest extant terristrial animals and can reach a height of 4m(13ft) and weigh 7,000 kg(15,000 lb).</P>
  <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk 
    or proboscis,used for many purposes,particularly breathing,lifting 
water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks,which can serve
as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging.Elephants large ear flaps help to control their body temperature.
Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while
Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
