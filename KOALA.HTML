               <h3>koalas</h3>
               <P>The koala ( typically inhabits  open eucalypts woodlands , and the leaves of  these  tress make up most of their diet/P>
               <P>Koalas can be found in southeastern and eastern Australia
                While koalas are a national symbol of Australia’s unique wildlife, they can only be found in the wild on the southeast
                
                and eastern sides of Australia, along the coastlines of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. 
                They live high up in eucalyptus trees of native bushlands and forests, usually perched between the forks of the tree’s branches.
                
                 
                
                . They have a verysupportive  butt…
                Living in trees and being wedged between rough branches requires a lot of support! Luckily, the koala has strong cartilage at 
                the end of their curved spine, allowing them to make eucalyptus trees a comfortable home!
                
                 </P>
                <p>Koalas survive on a diet of eucalyptus leaves and can eat up to a kilogram a day! Pretty impressive, considering eucalyptus is poisonous to most animals.Their special fibre digesting organ, called a caecum, helps to detoxify the chemicals in the leaves.

                    However, they can be quite picky eaters, eating less than 50 of 800 eucalypt species. Even then, they’ll often choose leaves at the top of the tallest trees that contain more liquid and nutrients – only the best for Australia’s koalas!
                    
                     
                    
                    . ‘Koala’ is thought to mean ‘no drink’ in the Australian Aboriginal language
                    It was thought that koalas didn’t need to drink because of the moisture they get from munching on juicy eucalyptus
                     leaves all day. However, they do drink from various water sources when needed, especially during heatwaves and in times of 
                     drought.
