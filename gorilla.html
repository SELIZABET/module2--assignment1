               <h3>gorilla</h3>
               <p>gorilla are ground -dwelling ,predominantly heerbivorous apes that inhabits the forests of central sub -saharan south africa</p>
               <p>The positive results with the gorillas were particularly interesting because, unlike other apes, they fail tests of mirror-self-recognition.
               
             <p>  With respect to faecal clumps that contained whole seeds, chimpanzees and gorillas passed 1.7 species of seed per defecation on average.</p>
        
              <p> The proportion of seeds handled by monkeys that were dropped was considerably larger than it was for gorillas.</p>
            
             <p>  Our results demonstrate that gorillas consume diets that differ by plant species and part, but contain similar concentrations of nutrients.</p>
